It is really hard for people to cut down on their carbon footprint because there is no easy way 
for them to see how their actions can change their carbon footprint. This is the problem that my 
app would solve. I propose an app that consolidates information on how a particular activity contributes 
to your carbon footprint. A comparable example would be a diet app that users insert their meals and 
the app keeps track of their calorie intake. Instead of keeping track of the user’s calories like a diet app, 
this app will keep track of the user’s carbon footprint. The name would be “Carbon Diet” since it shares similarities 
with diet apps. The app would also use gamification to motivate users to continue good habits such as turning off 
their lights when they don’t need them and buying more reusable products. There would also be a social aspect to the app. 
People would be able to share the goals and accomplishments on social media. Making the user’s carbon footprint visible 
and making it something that they can share with others will hopefully make lowering one’s carbon footprint as popular as 
one's weight.
